# JS For Humans

### `What is this all about?`

I have come across many people who have a certain hatred towards programming.
This hatred arises out of the fear of the unknown.

10-20 Known Programming Languages, Thousands of un-understandable sentences, wrapping
your head around 100-200 Basic Concepts in Computer Science.

And then, just like that, some new technology comes around, and whatever was
learnt becomes redundant. Right?

Absolutely Wrong.

The book begins by addressing this and many other issues, that people have when they start programming.

This said, this book is solely focused on :
1. learning JavaScript
2. Mastering the fundamentals of how JavaScript works
3. Learning the Advanced Concepts
4. Becoming one of the top JS Developers in the world.

## Who is this book for?

1. Beginner Devs:
   1. Students/Developers who have had minimal programming experience (probably
      just in school/college) and want to learn web development.
   2. Devs Who have some basic understanding of HTML & CSS, and wanâ€˜t to start
      working on JS, but find it confusing.
      
2. Intermediate Devs:
   1. Developers who are familiar with Basic JavaScript Concepts, and have used
      their coding skills to create some basic Interactive Web Pages.
   2. Devs who have worked for more than 3-4 Years on some other programming
      language, and now want to dive into the world of web-development.
