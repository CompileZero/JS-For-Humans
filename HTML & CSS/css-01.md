# What's CSS?

Okay, now we've began putting HTML elements on a page. Using our house-building analogy, this is like we have all the materials now in a pile in front of our house. However a pile of lumber does not make a house. We're going to start reasoning about how to put together these things, how to create our blueprints, our plans. CSS is really powerful and can accomplish a wide variety of things: colors, sizes, order, positioning, hiding, showing, animation, etc. We'll scratch the surface here, but know you can do a lot with just CSS. It's a deep subject and a powerful tool.
